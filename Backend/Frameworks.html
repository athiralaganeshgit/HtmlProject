    <p>The Java collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures.[1]

Although referred to as a framework, it works in a manner of a library. The collections framework provides both interfaces that define various collections and classes that implement them.

Differences from Arrays
Collections and arrays are similar in that they both hold references to objects and they can be managed as a group. However, unlike arrays, Collections do not need to be assigned a certain capacity when instantiated. Collections can grow and shrink in size automatically when objects are added or removed.

Collections cannot hold primitive data types such as int, long, or double.[2] Instead, Collections can hold wrapper classes such as java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long, or java.lang.Double.[3]

Collections are generic and hence invariant, but arrays are covariant. This can be considered an advantage of generic objects</p>
